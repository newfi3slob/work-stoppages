# Work stoppages dataset analysis

***HELLO!***  

## Dataset Introduction

The dataset at hand provides a comprehensive record of major strikes and lockouts that have occurred since 1993. It offers valuable insights into labor movements, including details about the organizations involved, the industry and ownership type of the employers, start and end dates of the strikes, the number of workers participating, and the total worker-days idle.

## Project Focus Areas

For the project, we will concentrate on three main aspects of the dataset to gain a deeper understanding of labor strikes and their impact:

1. **Severity of Strikes in the 2000s:** We will assess the severity of labor strikes during the 2000s, specifically by examining the "number of idle days." This metric will help us gauge the economic impact and the extent of disruption caused by strikes in this decade.

2. **Comparative Analysis: 2000s vs. 1980s:** To identify trends and changes in labor movements, we will compare the number of striking workers between the 2000s and the 1980s. This analysis will reveal whether there were notable shifts in the scale of strikes over these two decades.

3. **Severity Comparison with 2018-2019:** While our dataset primarily focuses on the 2000s, we will also draw attention to the severity of strikes in this period compared to the strikes that occurred in 2018-2019. We will consider both the "number of idle days" and the "number of striking workers" to emphasize any differences in the impact of these labor actions.

In the following sections, we will dive deeper into each of these focus areas, analyze the relevant data, and present our findings. These insights will provide a comprehensive view of the labor strike landscape, shedding light on historical trends and significant variations in strike severity and worker participation.
